# characterCreator

The purpose of this project is to get into Django and Python by building a little character creation for Dungeons and Dragons. 
Or maybe just imaginary Dungeons and Dragons, because I don't know exactly anything about recent types and version of this lovely boarding game. There will be drows, elves, dwarfs, thiefliengs, humans and all the rest of the managerie.
